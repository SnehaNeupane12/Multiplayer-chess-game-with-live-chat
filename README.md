# Pawn Me Freak

A vibrant chess game built with **React + Vite** (frontend) and **Node.js + Socket.IO** (backend).  
Play offline vs bots or online with friends â€” with live chat, auto-suggest messages, and flashy captures.


## Features
- Two modes:
  - Offline vs Bot
  - Online with friends via WebSockets
- Live chat with auto-suggest messages
- Capture splash: big flashes when a piece is taken.

- Server-side validation with [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js).


## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18, Vite, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- Game Logic: chess.js
- Bot: simple capture-loving AI
